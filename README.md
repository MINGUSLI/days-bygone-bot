# DaysBygoneBot

Description:
Bot to farm Rewind Count in Mobile Game "Days Bygone". 

To-Do:
    


Notes:
    
    Try different libs for image recognition of numbers. If nothing works, maybe train tesseract with font of days bygone?
        - Probably will need to cut out every number
        

Done:

    - Added functions to find buttons on screen needed to get to campaign.
    - Added function to screenshot current day
    - Added function to translate number in image to value (using pytesseract)
